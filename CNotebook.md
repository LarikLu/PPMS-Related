Since Python is a **scripting language**, it does not typically indicate if the program has bugs at first. If the program falls into an **infinite loop**, there is no warning or suggestion from the interpreter. Instead, the program will run **indefinitely** without producing an output, which means we can't see when it finishes.

To **diagnose what went wrong**, it is often suggested to have the program **output the values of its variables**. Additionally, **using debugging tools** can be very helpful.
